Question explanation
Question says we are given some linkedLists and we need to merge all linked lists into one and return that singular linked list.

Solution approach
We simply cannot loop over this multi dimensional linkedList and make them singular
Because as we know linkedList does not work like Array, if we loop over linkedList once we cannot go back
So easiest way to do this is by looping over every linkedList & put every element of that into an array
So now we have each element of linkedList in our array.
Now we sort array in descending order
WHY?
Because now when we will create new singular linkedList we we simply keep poping elements one by one from array
We could have did array.unshift() so we don't need to sort the array but as you know unshift method takes O(n) Time Complexity
So for each element we would do n and n and n so it will be very costly
So now We simply create a new linkedList by creating a new Node
While there are elements in array, keep linking elements of array into linkedList like node.next = array.pop();
And done we have our result, return this new desired linkedList.
